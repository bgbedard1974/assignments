Assignments Module

This module added functionality to the Masters in Educuation (MED) website to manage Assignments given by Facilitators and the work submitted by Learners.

Background

The MED program was based on communities that consist of two Facilitators (instructors), and many Learners (students). These communities used the MED website to collaborate on-line.  The site used Organic Groups to lock content for a specific community to only the members of that community. Facilitators could create nodes of the Assignment content type and Learners could create nodes of the Course Work content type. A Course work node was linked to an Assignment node.

When Facilitators viewed an Assignment node, they could see a list of all of the Learners in the Community and see if they had or had not yet created a Course Work node linked to that Assignment node.

When Learners viewed an Assignment node, they could see a link to the Course Work node they created or a link to create a Course Work node if they had not yet done so.

Facilitators could see a list of all the Assignment nodes they had created for a Community.

Learners could see a list of all Assignments nodes they had not yet created Course Work nodes for.
